====================================================================================

This package is a wrapper around the [VoteSmart](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/) [API](http://api.votesmart.org/docs/) written by your friendly neighborhood progressive tech organization, `r emo::ji("star2")` [*Deck Technologies*](https://www.deck.tools) `r emo::ji("star2")`. Feel free to use this package in any way you like.

VoteSmart provides information on US political candidates' positions on issues, votes on bills, and ratings by third party organizations, among other data.


### Installation

``` r
install.packages("votesmart")
```

Or the development version:

``` r
devtools::install_github("decktools/votesmart", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### API Keys

You'll need a VoteSmart API key in order to use this package. You can register for one [here](https://votesmart.org/share/api#.XjxqEjJKjOQ).

Store your key in an environment variable named `VOTESMART_API_KEY` with

```
Sys.setenv(VOTESMART_API_KEY = "<your_key>")
```

You can check that it's there with

```
Sys.getenv("VOTESMART_API_KEY")
```

This package never stores your key in your R session's global environment.

### An Example

VoteSmart collects ratings on various issues that Special Interest Groups (SIGs) give to political candidates.

Let's say we want to know how Elizabeth Warren tends to be rated on a few issues.

```{r}
library(votesmart)
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))
conflicted::conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr")
```

We'll first want to know what her VoteSmart `candidate_id` is. We can search for her using `candidates_get_by_lastname`:

```{r}
warrens <- 
  candidates_get_by_lastname(
    "warren", 
    election_years = 2012
  )

knitr::kable(warrens)
```

Filtering to her first name and taking her `candidate_id`, we can now grab Warren's ratings by all SIGs with `rating_get_candidate_ratings`.

```{r}
(id <- 
  warrens %>% 
  filter(first_name == "Elizabeth") %>% 
  pull(candidate_id)
)

ratings <- 
  rating_get_candidate_ratings(
    candidate_ids = id,
  )

knitr::kable(ratings %>% sample_n(3))
```

And compute on them:

```{r}
ratings %>% 
  filter(
    category_name_1 %in% 
      c("Environment", 
        "Fiscally Conservative",
        "Education", 
        "Civil Liberties and Civil Rights", 
        "Campaign Finance") 
  ) %>% 
  group_by(category_name_1) %>% 
  summarise(
    avg_rating = mean(as.numeric(rating), na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  arrange(category_name_1)
```

For more in-depth examples of how these all fit together, check out the vignette with:

```

```

### Available Functions

*These functions are named after the `snake_case`d version of the API [endpoints](http://api.votesmart.org/docs/).*

**If you see an endpoint you want to be made available in this package that isn't yet, feel free to submit an [issue](https://github.com/decktools/votesmart/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/decktools/votesmart/pulls)!**

**`rating_get_categories`**

Get rating `category_id`s and their associated `name`s (e.g. `"Abortion"`, `"Environment"`) given a vector of `state_id`s (optional)

**`rating_get_sig`**

Get information about a vector of SIGs (Special Interest Groups) given a `sig_id`


**`rating_get_sig_list`**

Get a dataframe of SIG (Special Interest Group) given a rating `category_id` and a `state_id` (optional)

**`votes_get_by_official`**

Get a dataframe of the way officials have voted on bills given a `candidate_id`, an `office_id` (optional), a `category_id` (optional) and a `year` the vote occurred (optional)


#### Package Data

Only a subset of all of the VoteSmart endpoints have yet been made available through this package.

You can see a full dataframe of the VoteSmart endpoints and their associated arguments with

```
data("endpoint_input_mapping")
```

or

```
data("endpoint_input_mapping_nested")
```

### Other Details

* This package currently contains no rate limiting infrastructure as there is very little information about what rate limits VoteSmart imposes, if any

* The VoteSmart API does not allow for bulk requests, i.e. a single request can only contain one value for each parameter
  * The functions in this package allow multiple inputs to be specified for each argument, but requests are sent one at a time for each combination of inputs
