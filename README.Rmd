# votesmart

This package is a wrapper around the [VoteSmart](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/) [API](http://api.votesmart.org/docs/).

VoteSmart provides information on US political candidates' positions on issues, votes on bills, and ratings by third party organizations, among other data.


## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("decktools/votesmart")
```

## API Keys

You'll need a VoteSmart API key in order to use this package. You can register for one [here](https://votesmart.org/share/api#.XjxqEjJKjOQ).

Store your key in an environment variable named `VOTESMART_API_KEY` with

```
Sys.setenv(VOTESMART_API_KEY = "<your_key>")
```

You can check that it's there with

```
Sys.getenv("VOTESMART_API_KEY")
```

This key is never stored in your R session's global environment.

## Available Functions

*These functions are named after the `snake_case`d version of the API [endpoints](http://api.votesmart.org/docs/).*

**If you see an endpoint you want to be made available in this package that isn't yet, submit an [issue](https://github.com/decktools/votesmart/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/decktools/votesmart/pulls)!**

Some of these functions are necessary precursors to obtain data you might want. For instance, in order to get candidates' ratings by SIGs, you'll need to get `office_level_id`s in order to get `office_id`s, which is a required argument to get candidate information using `candidates_get_by_office_state`.

For some examples, check out the vignette with:

```
vignette("votesmart")
```

Below is a summary of the functions currently available.

**`candidates_get_by_last_name`**

Get a dataframe of candidates given a vector of `last_name`s, `election_year`s (optional), and `stage_id`s (optional)

**`candidates_get_by_levenshtein`**

Get a dataframe of fuzzy-matched candidates given a vector of `last_name`s, `election_year`s (optional), and `stage_id`s (optional)

**`candidates_get_by_office_state`**

Get a dataframe of candidates by the state in which they ran for office given a vector of `state_id`s (optional), `office_id`s, and `election_year`s (optional)

**`election_get_election_by_year_state`**

Get a dataframe of election ids and their attributes given a vector of `year`s and `state_id`s (optional).

**`office_get_levels`**

Get the VoteSmart `office_level_id`s and their associated names (federal, state, local)

**`office_get_offices_by_level`**

Get `office_id`s and their associated names (e.g. `"President"`) for a given `office_level_id`

**`rating_get_candidate_rating`** 

Get SIG (Special Interest Group) ratings for candidates given a `candidate_id` and a `sig_id` (optional)


**`rating_get_categories`**

Get rating `category_id`s and their associated `name`s (e.g. `"Abortion"`, `"Environment"`) given a vector of `state_id`s (optional)

**`rating_get_sig`**

Get information about a vector of SIGs (Special Interest Groups) given a `sig_id`


**`rating_get_sig_list`**

Get a dataframe of SIG (Special Interest Group) given a rating `category_id` and a `state_id` (optional)

**`votes_get_by_official`**

Get a dataframe of the way officials have voted on bills given a `candidate_id`, an `office_id` (optional), a `category_id` (optional) and a `year` the vote occurred (optional)


## Package Data

Not all endpoints are yet available through this package.

You can see a full dataframe of the VoteSmart endpoints and their associated arguments with

```
data("endpoint_input_mapping")
```

or

```
data("endpoint_input_mapping_nested")
```

If you'd like a certain endpoint to be integrated into this pacage, feel free to submit a [pull request](https://github.com/decktools/votesmart/pulls) or an [issue](https://github.com/decktools/votesmart/issues)!


## Other Details

This package currently contains no rate limiting infrastructure as there is very little information about what rate limits there are, if any.

The VoteSmart API does not allow for bulk requests, i.e. a single request can only contain one value for each parameter. The funcitons in this package allow multiple inputs to be specified for each argument, but requests are sent one at a time for each combination of inputs.
