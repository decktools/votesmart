# votesmart

This package is a wrapper around the [VoteSmart](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/) [API](http://api.votesmart.org/docs/).

VoteSmart provides information on US political candidates' positions on issues, votes on bills, and ratings by third party organizations, among other data.


## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("decktools/votesmart")
```

## API Keys

You'll need a VoteSmart API key in order to use this package. You can register for one [here](https://votesmart.org/share/api#.XjxqEjJKjOQ).

<<<<TODO: insert demo key here>>>>

Store your key in an environment variable named `VOTESMART_API_KEY` with

```
Sys.setenv(VOTESMART_API_KEY = "<your_key>")
```

You can check that it's there with

```
Sys.getenv("VOTESMART_API_KEY")
```

This key is never stored in your R session's global environment.

## Available Functions

*These functions are named after the `snake_case`d version of the API [endpoints](http://api.votesmart.org/docs/).*

**If you see an endpoint you want to be made available in this package that isn't yet, submit an [issue](https://github.com/decktools/votesmart/issues) or a [pull request](https://github.com/decktools/votesmart/pulls)!**

Some of these functions are necessary precursors to obtain data you might want. For instance, in order to get candidates' ratings by SIGs, you'll need to get `office_level_id`s in order to get `office_id`s, which is a required argument to get candidate information using `candidates_get_by_office_state`.

Below is a summary of the functions currently available.

**`candidates_get_by_last_name`**

Get a dataframe of candidates given a vector of `last_name`s, `election_year`s (optional), and `stage_id`s (optional)

**`candidates_get_by_levenshtein`**

Get a dataframe of fuzzy-matched candidates given a vector of `last_name`s, `election_year`s (optional), and `stage_id`s (optional)

**`candidates_get_by_office_state`**

Get a dataframe of candidates by the state in which they ran for office given a vector of `state_id`s (optional), `office_id`s, and `election_year`s (optional)


**`office_get_levels`**

Get the VoteSmart `office_level_id`s and their associated names (federal, state, local)

**`office_get_offices_by_level`**

Get `office_id`s and their associated names (e.g. `"President"`) for a given `office_level_id`


**`rating_get_candidate_ratings`** 

Get SIG (Special Interest Group) ratings for candidates given a `candidate_id` and a `sig_id` (optional)


**`rating_get_categories`**

Get rating `category_id`s and their associated `name`s (e.g. `"Abortion"`, `"Environment"`) given a vector of `state_id`s (optional)


**`rating_get_sig_list`**

Get a dataframe of SIG (Special Interest Group) given a rating `category_id` and a `state_id` (optional)

**`votes_get_by_official`**

Get a dataframe of the way officials have voted on bills given a `candidate_id`, an `office_id` (optional), a `category_id` (optional) and a `year` the vote occurred (optional)
